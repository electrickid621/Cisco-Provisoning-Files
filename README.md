# Cisco-Provisoning-Files
A collection of files needed for registering Cisco phones with a system besides CUCM (Mostly FreePBX)

I have created this repository after I have recieved so many requests for files to help people register their Cisco phones with FreePBX. Here you will find all of the files from SEPMACs, to ringtones, even wallpapers. Please let me know if there are any files I am missing that you need by emailing me at electrickid620@icloud.com.
