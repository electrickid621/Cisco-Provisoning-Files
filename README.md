# Cisco-Provisoning-Files

I have created this repository after I have recieved so many requests for files to help people register their Cisco phones with FreePBX. Here you will find all of the files from SEPMACs, to ringtones, even wallpapers. Please let me know if there are any files I am missing that you need by emailing me at electrickid620@icloud.com.

# NOTE

Some downloads are still available on Cisco's website and will not be listed here due to regular updates, including phones in the 68, 78, 88, 98 series. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM, BUT YOU NEED TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT, NO SERVICE CONTRACT REQUIRED. There are other phones listed on the site still, such as the 7945, 65, and 75, but they aren't even updated so I'll leave them here. https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286320285
